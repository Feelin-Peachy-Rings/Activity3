# Activity3

In this activity we moved from low-fidility prototype to high-fidility prototype.
Most of work done in this activity has been done with Adobe XD. In Adobe XD, we have designed a high-fidelity prototype based on the best low-fidility prototype sketches. Through discussion and brainstorming, we came up with both desktop and mobile views.
